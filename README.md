# 📚 Libft 

**Libft** is the first project at 42 school.

## ✨ Project Description

The main goal of Libft is to develop our own library of C functions.

## 📖 Function Descriptions

### 1. String Manipulation Functions 📏

 These functions are essential for handling strings and are based on the standard functions from```<string.h>```:


  -```ft_strlen```: Calculates the length of a string.
  
  -```ft_strcpy, ft_strncpy```: Copies a string into another.
    
  -```ft_strdup```: Duplicates a string in a new memory block.
     
  -```ft_strcat, ft_strncat```: Concatenates strings.
  
  -```ft_strchr, ft_strrchr```: Locates characters in a string.
  
  -```ft_strcmp, ft_strncmp```: Compares strings.
  
  -```ft_strstr, ft_strnstr```: Finds substrings within a string.

###  2. Memory Manipulation Functions  💾

These functions are useful for manual memory management and are based on functions from ```<stdlib.h>```:

  -```ft_memset```: Fills a block of memory with a specific value.
  
  -```ft_bzero```: Fills a block of memory with zeros.
  
  -```ft_memcpy, ft_memccpy```: Copies memory from one location to another.
  
  -```ft_memmove```: Moves a block of memory.
  
  -```ft_memchr```: Searches for a byte in a block of memory.

  -```ft_memcmp```: Compares two blocks of memory.
  
  -```ft_calloc```: Allocates and clears a block of memory.
  
### 3. Conversion Functions 🔄

Functions that transform data between different types:

  -```ft_atoi```: Converts a string into an integer.
  
  -```ft_itoa```: Converts an integer into a string.
  
  -```ft_tolower, ft_toupper```: Converts characters between uppercase and lowercase.

### 4. Character Verification Functions 🔍

These functions are used to verify character types, similar to those in ```<ctype.h>```:

  -```ft_isalpha```: Checks if the character is alphabetic.
  
  -```ft_isdigit```: Checks if the character is numeric.
  
  -```ft_isalnum```: Checks if the character is alphanumeric.
  
  -```ft_isascii```: Checks if the character is ASCII.
  
  -```ft_isprint```: Checks if the character is printable.

### 5. Additional Functions ✨

These additional functions complement the basic library:

  -```ft_substr```:  Creates a substring from a given string.
  
  -```ft_strjoin```: Joins two strings into a new string.
  
  -```ft_strtrim```: Removes whitespace characters at the start and end of a string.
  
  -```ft_split```: Splits a string into substrings using a delimiter.
  
  -```ft_strmapi```: Applies a function to each character of a string, generating a new one.
  
  -```ft_putchar_fd```: Writes a character to a file descriptor.
  
  -```ft_putstr_fd```: Writes a string to a file descriptor.
  
  -```ft_putendl_fd```: Writes a string followed by a newline to a file descriptor.
  
  -```ft_putnbr_fd```: Writes a number to a file descriptor.

#### 6. 🏆 Bonus Functions

In the bonus part, functions are implemented to handle linked lists, a data structure that allows dynamic insertion and deletion of elements:

  **Linked List Creation and Management::**
  
  -```ft_lstnew```: Creates a new list node.
      
  -```ft_lstadd_front```: Adds a node at the beginning of the list.
      
  -```ft_lstadd_back```: Adds a node at the end of the list.
  
  -```ft_lstsize```: Calculates the number of nodes in a list.
  
  -```ft_lstlast```: Returns the last node of the list.
  
  -```ft_lstdelone```: Deletes a node from the list without freeing the entire list.
  
  -```ft_lstclear```: Deletes all nodes in the list and frees memory.
  
  -```ft_lstiter```: Applies a function to each node in the list.
  
  -```ft_lstmap```: Creates a new list by applying a function to each node.

## ⚙️ Compilation

To compile the library, clone this repository and run the command:

```C
make
```
